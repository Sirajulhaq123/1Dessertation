1	Overview
This repository contains the source code and experiments for the dissertation project "Analysis of Golf Swing Data for Shot Quality Classification." The project addresses the challenge of objectively assessing golf swing accuracy. Traditional coaching approaches are often subjective and heavily reliant on expensive, sensor-based, or video-driven systems, making them less accessible for amateur golfers. This work builds a machine learningâ€“based framework that classifies shot quality from structured datasets collected via Trackman LIDAR systems, focusing on swing and ball-flight parameters such as Club Speed, Face Angle, Swing Path, Launch Angle, Spin Rate, and Carry Distance. The pipeline operates on raw datasets, normalizes them to interpretable classes, executes regression-based classification models, and evaluates performance on standard metrics. The end product is an interpretable and scalable device providing data-driven feedback for coaches and players.
2	Provenance of Code
The entire code submitted here was written by the project researcher. No external AI code generators were used to write the code. The only external contributions are general open-source libraries used as per their licenses. Libraries used include Pandas, numpy for data handling and processing, Scikit-learn for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing, matplotlib, and seaborn for visualization, while ConfusionMatrixDisplay for model evaluation plots. No third-party or supervisor-provided code was incorporated.
3	Requirements
The project must run with Python 3.9 or higher. Currently, we use the 3.11.3 Python version. The code can be executed on multiple environments depending on user preference. It runs smoothly on Google Colab for cloud-based execution without local setup, within Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation, or in Visual Studio Code for a full development workflow.

4	How to Build and Run
This project pipeline follows a sequential workflow that begins with the loading of Trackman LIDAR datasets containing swing and ball-flight measurements. Raw data are preprocessed wherein quantile-based binning is utilized to transform numerical features into categorical shot quality labels of Great, Good, Average, Poor, and Bad. StandardScaler is utilized in the normalization of continuous features, while categorical ones are encoded using LabelEncoder, where appropriate. Following data preparation, two models are trained: Linear Regression for shot performance measure prediction and Logistic Regression for shot quality type classification. Models are compared on common performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and a confusion matrix is plotted for visualization of classification results. To enable further interpretability, results are visualized using matplotlib and seaborn. The whole analysis can be executed with the main script golf_swing_analysis.py in order for the pipeline to be executed smoothly from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
5	Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories and files to ensure clarity and reproducibility. The data folder is reserved for storing raw datasets, although these are not included in the repository due to size constraints and can be re-imported from the Trackman system. Experimental work is documented within the notebooks directory, which contains Jupyter notebooks used for testing, visualization, and exploratory analysis. Five datasets are stored in Excel format. The core functionality resides in the src directory, which includes separate modules for preprocessing routines (preprocessing.py), machine learning model training and evaluation (models.py), and supporting utilities (utils.py). All experimental results, such as confusion matrices, performance reports, and plots, are stored in the results directory for reference. The dependencies required to run the project are listed in the requirements.txt file, while the README.md provides detailed documentation of the workflow, usage, and objectives of the project.
6	Ethical Considerations
The project is in perfect adherence with academic integrity standards. All code was written by the author, with external use restricted to freely available libraries referenced above. This research demonstrates a scalable approach for shot quality classification in golf, offering Data-driven and objective assessments of golf swings. The datasets were scraped from public university official sources and held no sensitive data. To preclude responsible deployment risks, the retrieval layer includes a similarity threshold such that the chatbot refuses to reply to questions not within its domain, minimizing the chance of hallucination. The dissertation paper itself is not included here in accordance with submission guidelines. The system can be extended to other sports analytics applications requiring structured motion data analysis.
